## Extended color palette for darker darks

One of the most common feature requests we've had over the years is to add darker shades for every color — usually because someone is building a dark UI and just wants more options down in that dark end of the spectrum.

Well wish granted — in Tailwind CSS v3.3 we've added a new `950` shade for every single color.

In the grays they act as basically a tinted black, which is great for ultra dark UIs:

![Comparison between two dark user interfaces, one using slate-900 as the darkest color and the other using slate-950 as the darkest color](./950-slate.png)

And in the rest of the color spectrum we optimized `950` for high contrast text and tinted control backgrounds:

<div className="contents dark:hidden">
![Comparison between two light user interfaces, one using sky-900 as the darkest color and the other using sky-950 as the darkest color](./950-sky.png)
</div>

<div className="hidden dark:contents">
![Comparison between two light user interfaces, one using sky-900 as the darkest color and the other using sky-950 as the darkest color](./950-sky-dark.png)
</div>

Believe it or not the hardest part about this project was convincing ourselves to be okay with having 11 shades per color. Trying to make that look good in the [color palette documentation](/docs/customizing-colors) was a nightmare.

Also pour one out for the 50 shades of gray jokes we used to be able to make.

## ESM and TypeScript support

Now you can configure Tailwind CSS in ESM, or even in TypeScript:
